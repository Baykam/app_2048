# 2048 Game

This project develops the popular game 2048 using Flutter and Flutter Bloc libraries.

## Features

- Utilizes a 4x4 matrix to represent the game board.
- The game is played by sliding tiles on the matrix (right, left, up, down).
- After each move, a random value of 2 or 4 is assigned to an empty tile.
- Adjacent tiles with the same value merge together and their values are summed.
- The goal of the game is to reach the tile with the value of 2048.
